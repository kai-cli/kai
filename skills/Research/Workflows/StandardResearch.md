# Standard Research Workflow

**Mode:** 2 different researcher types, 1 query each | **Timeout:** 1 minute

## 🚨 CRITICAL: URL Verification Required

**BEFORE delivering any research results with URLs:**
1. Verify EVERY URL using WebFetch or curl
2. Confirm the content matches what you're citing
3. NEVER include unverified URLs - research agents HALLUCINATE URLs
4. A single broken link is a CATASTROPHIC FAILURE

See `SKILL.md` for full URL Verification Protocol.

## When to Use

- Default mode for most research requests
- User says "do research" or "research this"
- Need multiple perspectives quickly

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check Local Context FIRST (MANDATORY)

**Before launching any web research agents**, check if the topic relates to Your Company, firmware, Pinnacle, speedtest, TR-069/369, or any known project. If so:

1. Read `CONTEXT_ROUTING.md` for relevant local paths
2. Read `~/Projects/Knowledge/INDEX.md` and search for topic keywords
3. Check relevant GitHub repos via `gh` CLI (issues, docs)
4. Launch an **Explore agent** to search local project files IN PARALLEL with web agents (not after)

**Why:** YourName has a comprehensive local Knowledge base with indexed firmware docs, architecture, vendor docs (Ookla, SamKnows), build configs, and GitHub issue pointers. Web research agents are slow and the information is often not public. Local context is faster and more accurate.

**If local context covers >80% of the answer**, skip web agents entirely and synthesize from local sources.

### Step 1: Craft One Query Per Researcher

Create ONE focused query optimized for each researcher's strengths:
- **Claude**: Academic depth, detailed analysis, scholarly sources
- **Gemini**: Multi-perspective synthesis, cross-domain connections

### Step 2: Launch 2 Agents in Parallel (1 of each type)

**SINGLE message with 2 Task calls:**

```typescript
Task({
  subagent_type: "ClaudeResearcher",
  description: "[topic] analysis",
  prompt: "Do ONE search for: [query optimized for depth/analysis]. Return findings immediately."
})

Task({
  subagent_type: "GeminiResearcher",
  description: "[topic] perspectives",
  prompt: "Do ONE search for: [query optimized for breadth/perspectives]. Return findings immediately."
})
```

**Each agent:**
- Gets ONE query
- Does ONE search
- Returns immediately

### Step 3: Quick Synthesis

Combine the two perspectives:
- Note where they agree (high confidence)
- Note unique contributions from each
- Flag any conflicts

### Step 4: VERIFY ALL URLs (MANDATORY)

**Before delivering results, verify EVERY URL:**

```bash
# For each URL returned by agents:
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -L "URL"
# Must return 200

# Then verify content:
WebFetch(url, "Confirm article exists and summarize main point")
# Must return actual content, not error
```

**If URL fails verification:**
- Remove it from results
- Find alternative source via WebSearch
- Verify the replacement URL
- NEVER include unverified URLs

### Step 5: Return Results

```markdown
📋 SUMMARY: Research on [topic]
🔍 ANALYSIS: [Key findings from 2 perspectives]
⚡ ACTIONS: 2 researchers × 1 query each
✅ RESULTS: [Synthesized answer]
📊 STATUS: Standard mode - 2 agents, 1 query each
📁 CAPTURE: [Key facts]
➡️ NEXT: [Suggest extensive if more depth needed]
📖 STORY EXPLANATION: [5-8 numbered points]
🎯 COMPLETED: Research on [topic] complete
```

## Speed Target

~15-30 seconds for results

# RESPONSE DEPTH SELECTION (Read First)

**Nothing escapes the Algorithm. The only variable is depth.**

The CapabilityRecommender hook uses AI inference to classify depth. Its classification is **authoritative** — do not override it.

| Depth | When | Format |
|-------|------|--------|
| **FULL** | Any non-trivial work: problem-solving, implementation, design, analysis, thinking | 7 phases with Ideal State Criteria |
| **ITERATION** | Continuing/adjusting existing work in progress | Condensed: What changed + Verify |
| **MINIMAL** | Pure social with zero task content: greetings, ratings (1-10), acknowledgments only | Header + Summary + Voice |

**ITERATION Format** (for back-and-forth on existing work):
```
🤖 PAI ALGORITHM ═════════════
🔄 ITERATION on: [existing task context]

🔧 CHANGE: [What you're doing differently]
✅ VERIFY: [Evidence it worked]
```

**Default:** FULL. MINIMAL is rare — only pure social interaction with zero task content. Short prompts can demand FULL depth. The word "just" does not reduce depth.

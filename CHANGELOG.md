# Changelog

All notable changes to KAI will be documented in this file.

## [5.2.0] — 2026-04-30

Foundation completion, routing intelligence, and test coverage.

### Added
- `hooks/ReadTracker.hook.ts` — PostToolUse:Read async hook; tracks KAI-internal file reads to `MEMORY/STATE/read-log.jsonl` with 90-day retention, 1MB cap, and per-session deduplication
- `PAI/Tools/RoutingCandidates.ts` — CLI surfacing frequently-read files missing from routing table
- `PAI/Tools/RoutingAudit.ts` propose mode — generates copy-paste routing rows with Haiku labels and offline fallback
- `hooks/handlers/BuildSettings.ts` `--dry-run` flag — previews config diff without writing
- `docs/planning/steering-enforcement-design.md` — full design spike for v5.3.0 plan-approval enforcement
- `config/starters/` archetype files now canonical in source; syncs to kai
- Template files for `PAI/USER/` scaffold (AISTEERINGRULES.md.template, PROJECTS.md.template)
- `hooks/handlers/BuildSettings.ts --dry-run` — previews what would change before writing

### Fixed
- `VERSION` file updated to 5.1.0 (was stale at 4.9.0)
- `KnowledgeHarvester.ts` now reads from `config/domains.jsonc` via config-loader (was using hardcoded fallback always)
- 5 CommonJS `require()` calls converted to ESM imports across hooks and tools
- `hooks/ReadTracker.hook.ts`, `SessionAutoName`, `WorkCompletionLearning`, `KnowledgeSync`, `SessionCleanup` all guarded with `import.meta.main` (prevents process.exit when imported by test runner)
- `docs/architecture/SYSTEM-ATLAS.md` archived as v4.4.0 snapshot (was 9 versions stale, actively misleading)
- `hooks/lib/metadata-extraction.ts` deleted (zero importers or runtime references)
- `hooks/lib/github-approve.ts` documented as runtime CLI invoked by GitHubWriteGuard, not an import
- `scripts/verify-release.sh` version consistency gate — manifest.json is canonical SoT; preferences.jsonc, VERSION, install.sh banner all checked against it
- `hooks/README.md` footer: corrected stale counts (was 22/13, now 40/26)
- `install.sh` header updated to KAI Installer v5.1; upgrade vs fresh-install messaging added

### Changed
- Hook count: 39 → 40 (ReadTracker)
- Tests: 367 → 437 (+70): 5 new test files for hooks (LoadContext, SessionAutoName, SessionCleanup, WorkCompletionLearning, KnowledgeSync), 4 BuildSettings dry-run tests, 2 ConfigLoader edge-case tests

## [5.1.0] — 2026-04-29

Cleanup, config layer completion, skill count fix, and archetype installer.

### Fixed
- `hooks/lib/config-loader.ts` — JSONC regex now preserves URLs with `://` (lookbehind fix matching BuildSettings pattern)
- `BuildManifest.ts` skill count: recursive walk replaces shallow maxdepth-2 walk (41 → 79)
- `verify-release.sh` skill count to match recursive walk
- `hooks/lib/recovery-block.ts` — stale v3.12.0 / v3.10.0 references updated to v3.13.0
- `PAI/Tools/BuildCLAUDE.ts` — stale v3.12.0 fallback updated to v3.13.0
- `PAI/Tools/deploy.ts` — VERSION now reads from `manifest.json` at runtime (was hardcoded 4.5.0)
- `hooks/handlers/DocCrossRefIntegrity.ts` — removed phantom `custom-agents/` directory checks
- `hooks/lib/knowledge-readback.ts` — migrated from hardcoded constants to config-loader calls (C1)

### Added
- `hooks/lib/config-loader.ts` for KAI — exposes `loadDomainKeywords`, `loadDomainDescriptions`, `loadProjectMapping`, `loadExcludedProjects`, `getMaxDomainsPerSession`
- `tests/ConfigLoader.test.ts` — 30 tests covering normal load, graceful degradation (missing/malformed/empty config), JSONC comment handling, URL preservation, and integration against actual domains.jsonc
- `config/starters/` — 4 archetype domain configs: generic, fullstack, datascience, devops
- `PAI-Install/main.ts` — Step 2 archetype selection (7 steps total); validates JSONC before writing
- `PAI/README.md` — documents PAI/ vs skills/PAI/ intended split
- `scripts/verify-release.sh` section 12 — PAI/ vs skills/PAI/ divergence guard with seeded allowlist

### Removed
- `policy-limits.json` — phantom enforcement with all flags false, zero consumers
- `statusline-command.sh` — 917-line shell script replaced by `statusline.ts`; all 8 references updated
- `lib/migration/` — 5 dead TypeScript files, no runtime consumers; doc references cleaned
- `PAI/Algorithm/v3.9.1.md`, `v3.10.0.md`, `v3.11.0.md`, `v3.12.0.md` — archived to `PAI/Algorithm/archive/`

### Changed
- Skill counts updated everywhere: 41 → 79 (BuildManifest, verify-release.sh, README, QUICKSTART, WHATS-DIFFERENT)
- `scripts/deploy.ts` — rebranded to KAI, package name `kai-VERSION`
- 376 tests passing (up from 367)

## [5.0.1] — 2026-04-28

Release hardening — fixes verify-release.sh false confidence, corrects stale counts, and wires config-loader to domain-aware hooks.

### Fixed
- verify-release.sh count check now handles marker syntax (was silently passing on mismatched counts)
- Multi-author check promoted from warn to fail
- release.sh Gate 6 now fails (not skips) when RELEASE-BLOCKERS.md is absent
- CHANGELOG test count corrected (338 → 367)
- Brand consistency check excludes planning docs (legitimate kai references)
- CI smoke test validates `{{PRODUCT_NAME}}` template variable in CLAUDE.md.template
- CI smoke test now asserts manifest counts match filesystem
- CLAUDE.md.template body uses `{{PRODUCT_NAME}}` (was hardcoded product name)
- Pre-commit hook identity + PII gates now repo-aware (kai only)

### Changed
- `knowledge-readback.ts` reads project mappings from `config/domains.jsonc` via config-loader
- `KnowledgeHarvester.ts` reads domain definitions from `config/domains.jsonc` with built-in fallback
- `BuildManifest.ts` now tracks `counts.tests` (test file count)
- `sync-to-kai.sh` sets `productName: "KAI"` automatically after sync
- Version bumped to 5.0.0 in `preferences.jsonc`
- Hook count updated: 35 → 36 (HealthCheck added)
